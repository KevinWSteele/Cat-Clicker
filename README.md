# Cat-Clicker

Hi! You there - reading this sentence right now. I bet you love images of adorable cartoon cats.

I hope you enjoy my Cat Clicker. Click on the cat's name in the list to make it appear and to increase that cat's click count.
Click on the cat's photo to increase the view count for each cat. 

Press the administrator button to change the cat picture (by typing in a new URL), the click count, and the name. Click the 
"save" button to create the change and the "cancel" button to not save the change.


Model-View-Controller

I separated parts of my JavaScript code so that it is better organized.

Model:
In my JavaScript file, I have an array of objects with the cat information. This info is held within a model object.

View:
I also have a catView object, which contains the code for rendering the cat list and controlling what happens when the user 
interacts with the page.

Controller:
My octopus object contains code that helps to combine the model object with the catView object.
